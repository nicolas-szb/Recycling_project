## OIDv4_ToolKit

OIDv4_ToolKit allows you to download annotated images for detection or classification models.<br/> => https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit

## images_resize.py

images_resize allows you to resize your images in order to reduce weights of your global images folder.

## images_augmentation.py

images_augmentation allows you to perform data augmentation if you do not have enough images for your training.<br/>
You can find the Keras documentation for ImageDataGenerator class [here](https://keras.io/api/preprocessing/image/).

## labelImg

labelImg allows you to annotate images and to save it in PASCAL VOC or YOLO format.<br/> => https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg

You can see a quick tutorial by Joseph Nelson [here](https://blog.roboflow.com/labelimg/).

## Object-Detection-API

Object-Detection-API is a repository thatimplements Yolov3 using TensorFlow 2.0 and creates two easy-to-use APIs that you can integrate into web or mobile applications.

You can find the original repository that I took from theAIGuysCode [here](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/Object-Detection-API).
